To run the simulation:
1. We used Python3, the other dependencies that must be installed can be installed using '(sudo) pip3 install <module_name>', these are:
    math,
    heapq,
    random,
    numpy,
    matplotlib,
    scipy,
    sys,
    time,
    noise
    
2. Then, make sure you are inside of this repo directory, and then navigate to 'code' directory, full path is:
    'f-2020-b351-final-project/code/'

3.  Once inside the folder with the code, simply run the program using: 'python3 testing_analysis.py'. 
    This is a terminal program that will ask you for inputs
